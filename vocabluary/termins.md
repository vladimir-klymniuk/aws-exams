Hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes. The values are usually used to index a fixed-size table called a hash table. Use of a hash function to index a hash function to index a hash table is called hashing or scatter storage addressing. (разбросанное хранилище)

`Tree (graph theory)` In graph theory, a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices (вершины) are connected by exactly one path, or equivalently a connected acyclic undirected graph. A forest is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by at most one path, or equivalently an acyclic undirected graph, or equivalently a disjoint union of trees.

`B-tree.` In computer science, a B-tree is self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions on logarithmic time. The B-tree generalises the binary search tree, allowing for nodes with more that two childred.

```bash
`Binary search tree` In computer science, a binary search tree (BST), also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree data structure whose internal nodes each store a key greater that all the keys in the node’s left subtree and less that those in its right subtree.

`SOC` - Security operations center is a centralized unit that deals with security issues on an organizational and technical level. It comprises the three building blocks for managing and enhancing an organization's security posture: people, processes, and technology.
