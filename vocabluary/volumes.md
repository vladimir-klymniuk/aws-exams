`EBS`



```r
'EBS Volume type':
    'General Purpose SSD'
        General Purpose SSD (gp2 and gp3) volumes offer cost-effective storage that is ideal for a broad range of workloads.
    'Provisioned OPS SSD'
        Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 and io2) volumes provide low latency and are designed to meet the needs of 
        I/O - intensive workloads. 
        They are best for EBS-optimized instances.
    'Throughput Optimized HDD'
        Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) volumes provide low-cost magnetic storage that is a good fit for large, sequential workloads.
    'Cold HDD'
        Cold HDD (sc1) volumes provide low-cost magnetic storage that offers lower throughput than st1. sc1 is a good fit for large, sequential cold-data workloads that require infrequent access to data.
    'Magenetic'
        Magnetic (standard) volumes are best suited for workloads where data is accessed infrequently.
