To ensure the security of your AWS (Amazon Web Servuce) account, that are two AWS (Amazon Web Service) best practices for managing access keys?

    - Rotate access keys daily

    - Don't create any access keys, use IAM roles instead

    - Don't generate an access key for the root account user

    - Where possible, use IAM roles iwth temporary security credentials

    - Use MDA for access keys
