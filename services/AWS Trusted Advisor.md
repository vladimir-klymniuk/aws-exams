    The AWS Direct Connect cloud service is the shortest path to your AWS resources. While in transit, your network traffic remains on the AWS global network and never touches the public internet. This reduces the chance of hitting bottlenecks or unexpected increases in latency. When creating a new connection, you can choose a hosted connection provided by an AWS Direct Connect Delivery Partner, or choose a dedicated connection from AWS - and deploy at over 100 AWS Direct Connect Locations around the globe. With AWS Direct Connect SiteLink, you can send data between AWS Direct Connect locations to create private network connections between the offices and data centers in your gloval network.

        Extend your existing network - Once you link your network to AWS Direct Connect, you can use SiteLink to send data between your locations. When using SiteLink, data travels over the shortest path between locations.

        Manage large datasets - Ensure smooth and reliable data transfers at massive scale for real-time analysis, rapid data backup, or broadcast media processing.
