6. Which of the following is an advantage of moving from on-premise to AWS(Amazon Web Service) when it comes to costing.

    + Lower capex costs     + Variable opex costs
    - Higher capex costs    + Variable opex costs
    - Lower capex costs     + Fixed opex costs
    - Higher capex costs    + Fixed opex costs


`OPEX costs` - is an ongoing cost for running a product, business, or system. 

`CAPEX costs` - is the money an organization or coorporate entity spends to buy, maintain, or improve its fixed assets, such as buildings, vehicles, equipment, or land.

On-premise infustructure is a CAPEX, cause we own that physical servers and maximum available usage is fixed. Moving to cloud gaves us ability to pay on-demand services and have variable bills depends on real usage with ability to scale our infrastructure on request.
