    - AWS DynamoDB
    + AWS EC2 Instance
    - AWS RDS
    - AWS Aurora

Why, so? Let's get the short overview of following  services examples.

`AWS DynamoDB` - that is fully managed NoSQL database, that supports key-value paradigm for data and documents. She proposed as one of Amazon Web Services. Supplies several pricing modes based on RPS or traffic size throughout.

`AWS EC2 Instance` - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) - web service, `EC2` provides ability to users to rent servers which hosts at the amazon cloud. `EC2` service includes in Amazon Web Services infrastructure. Userfriendly web interface allows to get access to instance resources and manage connection interfaces around it and inside.

`AWS RDS` - (Amazon Relational Database Service) is managed relational database service for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariadDB, Oravle BYOL, or SQL Server.

`AWS Aurora` - is a relational database with MySQL and PostgreSQL compability. Aurora automatically allocates database storage space in 10-gigabyte increments, as needed, up to a maximum of 128 terabytes. Aurora offers automatic, six-way replication of those chunks across three Availability Zones for availability and fault-tolerance. Aurora MultiMaster allows creation of multiple read-write instances in an Aurora database across multiple Availability Zones, which enables uptime-sensitive applications to achive continuous write availability through instance failure.

Conclusion - Only AWS EC2 Instance is open for installation database inside.
